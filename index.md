# Yiming Gan


My name is **Yiming Gan (甘一鸣)**. I'm currently an assistant professor at Institute of Computing Technologies, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Before joining ICT, CAS, I received my PhD degree from [CS Department, University of Rochester](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/) in 2023 working with [Professor Yuhao Zhu](https://yuhaozhu.com/), my Master degree from [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/) with [Professor Yuan Xie](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/yuanxie) and my B.E degree from Beijing Institute of Technology. 

I do research in computer architecture, with emphasis on autonomous machines, including robots, autonomous vehicles and drones. I believe this is an exciting domain which may fundamentally change people's life. [**Research**](https://Gyiming.github.io/research) has more to offer. 

I always have openings for PhD/Master students, and **one opening for Postdoc** in 2025. If you love to do research in designing chips, building better software and hardware for next generation robots, and know how to program, send me an email at: ganyiming@ict.ac.cn. [**Prospective Students**](https://Gyiming.github.io/prostu) has more to offer.
